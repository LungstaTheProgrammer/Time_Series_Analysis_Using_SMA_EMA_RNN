# **Time Series Analysis Using SMA EMA RNN**

## **Description**

In This project I will demonstrate how to use 
Machine Learning Algorithms - Simple Moving Average,
Exponential Moving Average and Recurrent Neural Networks 
[using Tensorflow] - to do time series analysis, in partucilar:
Stock Market Prediction.

## **Getting Started**

Simply clone the repository and run the .ipynb file in jupyter
notebook, Goodgle Colabotary, or any other text editor that 
supports the iPython Notebook. And Just click the 'Restart & Run All'
option and the file will run itself...

## **Note:**
I got the recurrent network totally wrong and you will see how funny
the graphs look. But I got better in future projects, which are also
in my github where I employed the KERAS API. I then concluded that this
method of using Tensorflow is outdated.
